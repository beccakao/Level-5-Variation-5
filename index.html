			<h2>I know why the caged bird sings</h2>
			<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
			<div class="section1">
			<p>
			A free bird leaps on the back <br>
			Of the wind and floats downstream <br>
			Till the current ends and dips his wing <br>
			In the orange suns rays <br>
			And dares to claim the sky.<br>

			But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage <br>
			Can seldom see through his bars of rage <br>
			His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br>
			So he opens his throat to sing.<br>
	
			The caged bird sings with a fearful trill <br>
			Of things unknown but longed for still <br>
			And his tune is heard on the distant hill for <br>
			The caged bird sings of freedom.<br>
		
			The free bird thinks of another breeze <br>
			And the trade winds soft through <br>
			The sighing trees <br>
			And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright <br>
			Lawn and he names the sky his own.<br>
		
			But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams <br>
			His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream <br>
			His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br>
			So he opens his throat to sing.<br>
			
			The caged bird sings with <br>
			A fearful trill of things unknown <br>
			But longed for still and his <br>
			Tune is heard on the distant hill <br>
			For the caged bird sings of freedom. <br>
